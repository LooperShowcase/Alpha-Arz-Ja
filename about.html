      Futbol Club Barcelona (listen), commonly referred to as Barcelona and
      colloquially known as Barça , is a professional football club based in
      Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain, that competes in La Liga, the top flight of
      Spanish football.

      Founded in 1899 by a group of Swiss, Catalan, German, and English
      footballers led by Joan Gamper, the club has become a symbol of Catalan
      culture and Catalanism, hence the motto "Més que un club" ("More than a
      club"). Unlike many other football clubs, the supporters own and operate
      Barcelona. It is the fourth-most valuable sports team in the world, worth
      $4.76 billion, and the world's fourth richest football club in terms of
      revenue, with an annual turnover of €582.1 million. The official Barcelona
      anthem is the "Cant del Barça", written by Jaume Picas and Josep Maria
      Espinàs. Barcelona traditionally play in dark shades of blue and garnet
      stripes, hence nicknamed Blaugrana.
